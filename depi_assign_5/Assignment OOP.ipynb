    "## Question: Build a Basic Calculator Class\n",
    "\n",
    "In a small town, Alex, a budding programmer, wanted to build something useful to help with everyday calculations. One day, they decided to create a **Smart Calculator**—a simple yet powerful tool that could perform basic arithmetic operations effortlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alex's goal was to design a **Python class** that could handle **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division**. However, they faced a challenge: what if someone tries to divide by zero? The calculator needed to be smart enough to **prevent errors** and give a meaningful message instead of crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "After hours of coding, Alex successfully created the **Calculator** class, which could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add** two numbers\n",
    "- **Subtract** one number from another\n",
    "- **Multiply** two numbers\n",
    "- **Divide** two numbers (handling division by zero gracefully)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your task is to **help Alex complete this project** by implementing the `Calculator` class with the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Coding Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ Create a class named `Calculator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ Implement four methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `add(self, a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.\n",
    "- `subtract(self, a, b)`: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.\n",
    "- `multiply(self, a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.\n",
    "- `divide(self, a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. If `b` is zero, return **\"Error: Division by zero.\"** instead of throwing an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ Create an instance of the `Calculator` class and test each method with the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calc.add(10, 5)` → **Expected output:** `15`\n",
    "- `calc.subtract(10, 5)` → **Expected output:** `5`\n",
    "- `calc.multiply(10, 5)` → **Expected output:** `50`\n",
    "- `calc.divide(10, 2)` → **Expected output:** `5.0`\n",
    "- `calc.divide(10, 0)` → **Expected output:** `\"Error: Division by zero.\"`\n"

    "## Modeling a Simple Library System\n",
    "\n",
    "Emma always dreamed of having a small community library where people could **borrow and share books** freely. She envisioned a simple system where books could be **added to a collection** and **viewed easily** whenever someone wanted to check what was available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determined to bring her idea to life, Emma decided to build a **basic library management system** using Python. She broke the problem down into two main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1️⃣ **Books** - Each book should have a **title** and an **author**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ **Library** - A collection of books where new books could be **added** and **listed** for readers to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, Emma designed the system using **two classes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Coding Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Class `Book`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has an `__init__` method that takes `title` and `author` as arguments.\n",
    "- Has a `display()` method that prints the book's details in the format:\n",
    "  `\"Title: <title>, Author: <author>\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Class `Library`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Has an `__init__` method that initializes an **empty list** to store books.\n",
    "- Has an `add_book(book)` method to **add a book** to the collection and print a confirmation message.\n",
    "- Has a `list_books()` method that prints `\"Library books:\"` followed by the details of all stored books using the `display()` method of the `Book` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Example Usage:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create two books: `\"1984\"` by **George Orwell** and `\"To Kill a Mockingbird\"` by **Harper Lee**.\n",

    "\n",
    "A construction company needs a system to calculate the area and perimeter of different shapes they use in their projects. They require a flexible system that allows easy addition of new shapes in the future while enforcing a standard structure for all shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement an abstract class called `Shape`, which defines two abstract methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `area()`: To calculate the area of a shape.\n",
    "2. `perimeter()`: To calculate the perimeter of a shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must then create two concrete classes—`Circle` and `Rectangle`—that inherit from `Shape` and provide their own implementations for these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define an **abstract class** `Shape` using the `ABC` module.\n",
    "   - It should have two abstract methods: `area()` and `perimeter()`.\n",
    "2. Implement a `Circle` class that inherits from `Shape`:\n",
    "   - It should take `radius` as an argument.\n",
    "   - Implement `area()` using the formula: **π × radius²**\n",
    "   - Implement `perimeter()` using the formula: **2 × π × radius**\n",
    "3. Implement a `Rectangle` class that inherits from `Shape`:\n",
    "   - It should take `length` and `width` as arguments.\n",
    "   - Implement `area()` using the formula: **length × width**\n",
    "   - Implement `perimeter()` using the formula: **2 × (length + width)**\n",
    "4. Write a function `print_shape_details(shape)` that takes a `Shape` object and prints:\n",
    "   - The **area** of the shape.\n",
    "   - The **perimeter** of the shape.\n",
    "5. Create instances of `Circle` and `Rectangle`, then pass them to `print_shape_details()` to display their calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output (Example)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Abstract Classes and Interfaces:\n",
